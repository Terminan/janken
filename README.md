This project is practice for Javascript through the creation of a rock-paper-scissors game to be played in the browser. I have chosen to use the Japanese terms for the game as a fun modification.

Simply click on your choice of rock, paper, or scissors and see whether you won, lost, or tied. The first to reach five round wins will win the entire game.
